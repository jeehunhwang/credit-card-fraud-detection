# Credit Card Fraud Detection
### Aaron Gabriel, Ramon Gonzalez, Jimmy Hwang

Credit card fraud poses a significant challenge to financial institutions due to the high volume of transactions and the complexity of detecting deceptive patterns in real time. Fraudulent transactions are rare events, often constituting less than 5% of total transactions, which creates a severe class imbalance problem (TransUnion, 2023). Traditional detection systems fail to adapt to evolving fraud tactics, creating a reliance on machine learning models that can handle non-linear relationships and rare event behaviors.

This project aims to develop a predictive model to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or not fraudulent using the Credit Card Fraud dataset from Kaggle, which contains 284,807 transactions with 492 labeled as fraudulent (Machine Learning Group - ULB, 2017). Given the datasetâ€™s high class imbalance, the proposed approach integrates Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks to achieve optimal detection performance.

Among all models tested, Random Forest delivered the strongest overall performance. It achieved the highest AUC (0.981), indicating superior ability to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions, and matched the top models in accuracy (0.999). Most importantly, it balanced precision (0.745) and recall (0.833) far better than others, meaning it successfully detected most fraud cases while keeping false alarms low. Models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees struggled with extremely low precision, while the Neural Network, though close in performance, was slightly less stable and interpretable. Overall, Random Forest offered the best trade-off between sensitivity and reliability, making it the most effective and trustworthy model for real-world fraud detection.
